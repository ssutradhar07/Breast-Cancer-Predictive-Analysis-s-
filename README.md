# Breast-Cancer-Predictive-Analysis-s-
A machine learning model to classify breast cancer with 97% accuracy.

# 🏥 Breast Cancer Classification & Diagnosis

## 🎯 Overview
This project focuses on building a high-accuracy machine learning model to diagnose breast cancer as Malignant or Benign. Developed as a professional portfolio piece, this model achieves significantly higher accuracy than the baseline requirement.

## 📊 Key Results
- **Final Accuracy:** 97.3%
- **Best Model:** Logistic Regression (Standardized)
- **Baseline Requirement:** 85.0%

## 🛠️ Project Workflow
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and applied `StandardScaler` to normalize numeric features.
- **Visual Analysis:** Used Heatmaps and Pairplots to identify key features influencing cancer diagnosis.
- **Model Training:** Compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
- **Evaluation:** Utilized Confusion Matrix and Classification Reports for deep performance analysis.
